# LEXICAL_ANLYSER
A Lexical Analyser is the preliminary phase of a compiler that performs lexical analysis, transforming a raw character stream into a structured sequence of tokens. It eliminates extraneous symbols (whitespace, comments), detects lexemes, classifies them into token categories, and furnishes these to the syntax analyser for higher-level parsing.
